                <h3>Marriage</h3>
                <p>

                    It is said that like poles repel while unlike poles attract,I would like to believe it is the same
                    thing that happened to
                    Patricia Noah and Abel her husband. The irony comes in when Abel marries Patricia who is quite the
                    opposite of what he wanted instead she was an independent woman who had her stuff planned out and
                    her life figured out. As mentioned in the book Patricia describes Abel as an “Exotic bird collector”
                    in his mind he thought he could manipulate her and try and change her to be the woman she wanted
                    that is the subservient woman, but Patricia stood her ground and did not allow Abel to step all over
                    her just because he was a man. An instance is where Abel comes home drank, tries to cook and
                    Patricia tells him not to because he might burn down the house and Abel hits her, she doesn’t
                    hesitate she rushes straight to the police station.<br>

                    Take an instance of Dinky he thinks that by beating up the wife it makes hime feel more manly and all that
                    I mean I do not blaim him and Abel for thinking that because they were brought up in such an environment 
                    where a woman is supposed to submissive and obidient all the time and if she is not the husband is supposed to 
                    beat her up or something.

                    According to the era, we are living in no woman wants to be a man’s slave, every woman wants to be
                    independent they want to hustle and be able to provide for themselves they don’t want to always be
                    asking for money from their husbands because it reaches a time “your husband” will start feeling
                    like you are becoming a burden to him and at that time you were just a house-wife what will happen
                    next? what will you do then? A man might want a traditional wife and all that but ends up marrying a
                    modern one so that he can try and change to something else a housewife maybe so be smart to make the
                    right decision.

                    Even in the 21st century we still have narcissist men who are still living in the stone age I mean 
                    we are in the 2st century they need to upgrade.

                <h3>Instances Trevoh uses Humor</h3>
                <p>

                    Trevoh has used a lot of humor in his book, some of the instances are when his mother throws him out
                    of a moving vehicle at the beginning of the book to save themselves but then Trevoh instead of being
                    grateful for that he questions his mother asking why she threw him out ”At least they would have
                    woken me up before they killed me” this shows even as a small child Trevoh could find a way to turn
                    any situation into some form of a joke.<br>

                    Another instance is when Trevoh and the mother were not talking to each other she opted to send him
                    letters to pass her points and Trevoh wouldn’t have to argue with her, but Trevoh still sent her
                    replies challenging her like the instance where the mother was talking about his grades and he still
                    got to tell the mum that he got it from her.<br>

                    When Trevor was about to get mugged by a group of Zulu guys because they thought he was white but
                    Trevor used his humor to evade been mugged and told them that instead of him they should all mug
                    someone else and by this, he was able to evade been mugged.<br>

                    Trevoh never fitted in any group be it the blacks he was told that  he was too light and with the whites 
                    he was told that he was too dark again in this sence Trevoh used his sence of humor to atleast get friends
                    like in school he never really had a group of people he could call his friend but he was able to hang 
                    out with the "cool kids in school".

                    Trevoh was known to be a naughty kid even when he was a little boy for instance at school when he
                    got
                    punished by the principal he laughed I mean in normal settings when a kid is been spanked or beaten
                    they
                    are expected to be crying ,but Trevoh instead used to laugh because he thought that the principal
                    spankings
                    were weak ,and the principal sent him to see a phychologist because that is not normal for any
                    child.
